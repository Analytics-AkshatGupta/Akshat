## üõ† **Key Tasks**

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Setup**  
- Extracted datasets from Snowflake, including **Orders**, **Customers**, **Products**, and **OrderDetails**.  
- Loaded the data into Pandas DataFrames for seamless analysis and manipulation.  

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Cleaning**  
- Identified and resolved duplicate records.  
- Handled missing values by:  
  - Replacing numeric missing values with column averages.  
  - Substituting categorical missing values with the most frequent value (mode).  

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Joining**  
- Merged multiple datasets to create a unified dataset containing **order details**, **customer profiles**, **product information**, and **line items** for comprehensive analysis.  

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Date & Time Analysis**  
- Extracted key date/time attributes like **Year**, **Month**, and **Day of the Week** for granular insights.  
- Developed custom metrics like **days_since_order** to measure order recency.  
- Grouped data by **Year** and **Month** to compute total and average revenue.  

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Advanced Aggregations**  
- Identified **top-performing customers** by revenue.  
- Evaluated **order trends by region** and analyzed category-wise performance.  
- Conducted product-level trend analysis to spot monthly sales declines.  

### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Advanced Timedelta Analysis**  
- Simulated delivery dates by adding a 5-day offset to the order date.  
- Flagged late deliveries based on predefined thresholds.  
- Calculated **average order intervals per customer** to understand purchase behavior.  

### **7Ô∏è‚É£ Visualizations**  
- Designed dynamic charts to illustrate **monthly revenue trends**, **top-performing regions**, and **category breakdowns**.  
- Used actionable visualizations to make data insights intuitive and impactful.
